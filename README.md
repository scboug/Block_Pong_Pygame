Welcome to Block Pong!
———
This is a Pygame project where the player has control of a paddle to bounce a ball to break blocks. 
When a block is hit it disappears and reappears at a random location. 
The more blocks that you hit the more points you will gain.
BUT be careful as if you do not keep the ball up and it drops below the paddle the game will be OVER!
ENJOY!
